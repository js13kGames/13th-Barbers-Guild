## Tips

* On each level, you must find the right combination of ingredients to solve
  the current patient disease.
* There are 4 different levels: the first one requires 1 ingredient to cure a
  disease, the other levels will increase the number of required ingredients by
  one. Notice that the other ingredients are the same, if you still remember
  what they are :)
* There are 3 possible diseases identifiable by their symptoms, which is always
  the same for the same disease.
